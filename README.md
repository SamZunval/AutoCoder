# AutoCoder
This repository contains the AutoCoder project, developed as part of the HyperSkill "AutoCoder" program. It is a fully-featured GitHub composite action designed to automate the process of code generation using OpenAI's ChatGPT based on issue descriptions. Whenever an issue with a specific label is opened, reopened, or labeled, this action automatically runs a script that sends the content of the issue to ChatGPT. The AI then generates production-ready code, saves it to the repository, commits the generated files, and opens a pull request for review. This workflow enables teams and individual developers to automate repetitive coding tasks, streamline their development process, and integrate AI-powered code generation directly into their GitHub workflow. Users can customize the label that triggers the action, specify the script path, and configure other inputs to adapt the action to various project needs. AutoCoder not only reduces manual effort but also ensures consistent code quality and faster iteration.
